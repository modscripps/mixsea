Plotted in green are values that have passed quality control and in red those that were rejected by some criteria. The plot looks a bit odd because there are jumps in $\\epsilon$. This is caused by small overturns adjacent to large overturns. Ultimately, a lot of small overturns will be rejected by quality control. Third from the left is buoyancy frequency, which can be calculated in a number of different ways. We will explore this in more detail later. Last are Thorpe displacements and Thorpe length scale.

In this case, overturns will be diagnosed from the conservative temperature profile or temperature profile, depending on the equation of state chosen. Buoyancy frequency will be estimated from the equation of state or potential density as specified by `N2_method`.\n",

Overturns will be diagnosed from the pseudo potential density profile. Depending on the `N2_method` chosen, buoyancy frequency may be estimated from pseudo potential density or the equation of state at constant salinity. As such, buoyancy frequency values will be incorrect in the ocean but perhaps useful for estimating $\\epsilon$. It is probably a good idea to choose a plausible salinity value, such as 0 psu for a fresh water environment or 35 psu for an ocean environment.\n",
