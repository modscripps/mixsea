    # 3. Run Ruff check (LINTING) - Fails if there are style errors or bugs
    - name: Run Ruff check
      # 'uv run' executes ruff from the installed environment
      run: uv run ruff check .

    # 4. Run Ruff format (FORMATTING) - Fails if code is not formatted correctly
    - name: Run Ruff format check
      # The '--check' flag ensures ruff exits with an error code if formatting is needed
      run: uv run ruff format . --check

    # 5. Run tests
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
